## Installation

Every *tinytool* has a Makefile that you can edit the variables to match where to install it and where to place default config files (the default namespace is `/usr/bin`).

Afterwards enter the following command to install the **tinytool** (if necessary as root):

```bash
make install
```

To uninstall the **tinytool** you can run:

```bash
make uninstall
```
