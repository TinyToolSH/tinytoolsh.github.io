# Tinytools home & docs

**TinyToolSH**, or just tinytools, is an acronym for Tiny Tools written in SHELL script.
Our projects are designed to improve your productivity in a simple way.

Its docs are written in md + mdx files managed by the Astro static site generator + Starlight documentaion template.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                            |

## ðŸ“– Fetching readme files from remote repositories

Each script page is its own repository's readme file. To help on syncing the pages with the remote readmes, it can now fetch the latest readme from each script remote repos so it keeps the single source of truth nature.

You can update your files anytime by calling `npm run readme`. This same command will always be executed before build start.
