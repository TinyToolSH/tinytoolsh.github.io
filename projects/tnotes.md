## Usage

`tnotes` can create, rename and delete notes.

We can do that you by using the options listed bellow:

* `-p`, `--path`: informs the path where the notes will be (or are) being stored;
* `-a`, `--add` `<name>`: adds a new note with the title received as argument on the path informed with `--path`;
* `-s`, `--sub` `<subname>`: adds a subtitle received as argument in the note metadata of the note;
* `-t`, `--tags` `<tags>`: adds tags to the note metadata of the note;
* `-l`, `--list`: lists the notes in stored in the path informed with `--path`;
* `-r`, `--rename` `<name>` `<new name>`: rename note file withe the name informed as argument;
* `-d`, `--delete` `<name>`: deletes a note with the title received as argument on the path informed with `--path`;

### Examples:

In these examples we are assuming that your notes dir is `~/notes/`.

* To `add` a note with `subtitle` and `tags`:

```bash
$ tnotes --path ~/notes/ --add "Test Note" --sub "This is a Test" --tags "test, note, markdown"
~/notes/Test Note.md added!
```

Afther this you can add your content by editing the note with your favorite text editor.

* To `list` the notes:

```bash
$ tnotes --path ~/notes/ --list
Test Note.md
```

In this example the note metadata will be:

```bash
$ cat ~/notes/Test\ Note.md
---
title: "Test Note"
subtitle: "This is a Test"
date: "2021-03-18 23:10:21"
tags: test, note, markdown
---
```

* To `rename` a note:

```bash
$ tnotes --path notes/ --rename "Test Note.md" "New Note"
 renamed to New Note.
```

* To `delete` a note:

```bash
$ tnotes --path notes/ --delete "New Note"
notes/New Note deleted!
```

And that's it!
